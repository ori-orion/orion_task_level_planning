# Nav and Look package.

The main aim here is to, with a target location and orientation in mind, navigate around an object while looking at it to build up a slightly better point cloud of the object. 

This will mainly actually use the pair of stereo cameras on the front of the robot. 

Point clouds will be used for mapping. I would like this to be able to operate in unmapped environments as opposed to mapped ones.
